  * [Reporting a Vulnerability](#reporting-a-vulnerability)
  * [Disclosure Policy](#disclosure-policy)

## Reporting a Vulnerability 

The team and community take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank 
you for improving the security of our open source software. We appreciate 
your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to 
acknowledge your contributions.

Report security vulnerabilities by emailing the team at:
    
    security at xaviesteve.com

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email within 24-72 hours. 
After the initial reply to your report, the team will endeavor to keep 
you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, 
and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security vulnerabilities in third-party modules to the person or 
team maintaining the module.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it
to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release
process, involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes
    will be released as fast as possible to the repository.
